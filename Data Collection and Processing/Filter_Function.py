#filter function takes two arguments, a function and a sequence. The function takes one item and return True if the item should. 
#It is automatically called for each item in the sequence. We donâ€™t have to initialize an accumulator or iterate with a for loop.


#the following function takes a sequence of numbers as imput and using filter function, returns only even numbers
