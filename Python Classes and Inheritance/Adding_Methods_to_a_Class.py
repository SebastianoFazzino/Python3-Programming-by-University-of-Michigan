#Exercise:
#Create a class called Animal that accepts two numbers as inputs and assigns them respectively to two instance variables: arms and legs. 
#Create an instance method called limbs that, when called, returns the total number of limbs the animal has. To the variable name spider, assign an instance of Animal that has 4 arms and 4 legs. 
#Call the limbs method on the spider instance and save the result to the variable name spidlimbs.
